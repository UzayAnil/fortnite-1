It is available in three distinct game mode versions: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build, Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing, and Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The most common game mode is Battle Royale. Fortnite is a free game that also has in-app purchases. </p>

  <h4 id="skins"> Skins </h4>
  <p>In fortnite, there are things called skins, there are a few ways to get outfits in Fortnite, you can get them from the Cash Shop with V-Bucks, another way it is to earn advancing tiers in the Battle Pass season. The last method is to buy from different promotions like the Twitch Prime Pack. When you begin playing fortnite, you are automatically given a default skin. There are 5 types of outfits in Fortnite, the Common (Gray), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), Epic (Purple) and Legendary (Orange). Skins can be bought to make your character look better but they do not give you advantages. </p>
  <h5 id="emotes"> Emotes </h5>
  <p>Emotes (also referred to sometimes as "Dances" or "Dance Emotes") in Fortnite Battle Royale, can be purchased in Shop or earned through the Battle Pass. You can purchase emotes using v-bucks, similar to skins. Emotes are commonly used when gamers succeed to a Victory Royale. Emotes are not neccesary to play Fortnite but they are a nice thing to have. When you create your Fortnite account you utomatically begin with the default dance.  </p>
